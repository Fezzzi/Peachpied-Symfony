Contains bare bones symfony projects created by running
```
composer create-project symfony/skeleton "{version}" {version}
```

This folder is used for different symfony components compilation attempts that will result in further enhancemenr of `libsConfig.json` file.

Exception is the `4.2.3` folder that contains edited libraries to supress uncompilable behaviour.
